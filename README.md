# Tensorflow_2.1
Models of Tensorflow-Keras using latest version of tensorflow

Models-
1)TensorFlow_Minimal_Least_squares_DL-
                                      
Very basic Deep Learning model using Tensorflow. Here we are creating linear regression using tensorflow.Random dataset is used.
Steps include-
a)Import the relevant libraries
b)Data generation
c)Solving with TensorFlow
d)Extract the weights and bias
e)Extract the outputs (make predictions)
f)Plotting the data

2)MNIST_Hand-Writen_digit_recognition-

It's Deep learning model of 4 layers(including input and output layers). We are using Tensorflow. Activation function relu for hidden layers and softmax for output layer is used. One-Hot Encoding to encode the digits. 28cross28 pixel each image is there.784 input nodes and 10 output nodes(1 for each digit). %0 unit in each hidden layer. Adam(most advanced optimizer) is used.We obtain accuracy of 97%+.
